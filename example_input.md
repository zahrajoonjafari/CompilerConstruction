# Example Input

Some example inputs for the compiler are already provided.
These examples are to be used as integration tests.

Your initial task is to create another example which may be added to the set.

Try to use as many features of the mC language as possible.
The example may read from `stdin` and write to `stdout` using the built-in functions.

Provide `.stdin.txt` and `.stdout.txt` files for verification purposes.

The getting started code-base provides a stub for the mC compiler.
It converts mC to C and compiles the result using GCC.

See [Submission Guideline](submission.md).
